Intelligent Namespacing for Composable and Modular Shell Scripts

Easily call and reference one shell script from another. Create modular multi-file shell script projects, where each script can automatically call any other script or executable in the project. No working directory, $PATH or $0 setting boilerplate required. Import references to shell scripts (or executables) and automatically namespace-scope it within the running script.
